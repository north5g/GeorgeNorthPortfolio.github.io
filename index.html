        <p>A project created in Web Systems, EECS 485, at the University of Michigan 
            with the help of Dominick Tressler. This code creates a website with 
            properties similar to Instagram, where the user may comment, 
            like, and post to their account while interacting with others.

        <p>A project created in Web Systems, EECS 485, at the University of Michigan 
            with the help of Dominick Tressler. This code creates a search engine that 
            works similar to Bing or Google. The user may put in a search phrase, in 
            addition to the weight of their query (how exact their query should be to the 
            provided results) and be provided with search results based on their input.

        <h1>TravelingPokemonTrainer</h1>
        <p>A project created in Data Structures and Algorithms, EECS 281, at the 
            University of Michigan. This code asks for a number of "Pokemon" and 
            their grid coordinates, and depending on the mode that was determined 
            when the program is ran, generates the Minimal Spanning Tree, the 
            efficient solution, or the most optimal solution.
