This is a program that creates a scalable search engine similar to 
websites such as Bing or Google.

When prompted, enter a search query, the weight that should be accounted 
when searching using the provided query, then submit the two. Using both 
text and link analysis, a pipeline of MapReduce functions analyze and 
return appropriate webpages. The webpages are then used to create a 
proper search result with a link to the designated webpage.
